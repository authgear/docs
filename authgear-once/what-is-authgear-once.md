# What is Authgear ONCE

Remember when you only paid once for your software? You owned the software and had complete control over your data and services. Today's SaaS model has evolved into an extortionate practice where service providers hold customers hostage. If you stop paying, you lose access to critical infrastructure and your data.

Identity and authentication are core infrastructures for most services that organizations and developers build. Hence, we believe that the SaaS model that doesn't offer true ownership and penalizes growth by correlating cost with growing MAUs isn't always right for you.

Also, running your IAM on the same VM as the rest of your application is simpler and more reliable for smaller projects.

### What is Authgear ONCE

Authgear ONCE is an option that lets you pay once to own your IAM solution for life. There are no monthly fees, no surprise bills, and you're not vendor locked-in.

Authgear ONCE is a version of Authgear that you can install on any Virtual Machine running Linux. The installation process is as easy as running a single line command.

### Authgear ONCE is suitable for you if:

* **Simple server/traffic requirements**: High availability, cross-region or multi-server deployment model is not supported by Authgear ONCE.
* **One project only**: on Authgear ONCE, you can only create one project
* **No WhatsApp OTP support**: Authgear ONCE does not support sending OTP to users via the WhatsApp messaging platform. However, there's support for sending OTP via email and SMS.

description: How Authgear is configured

# Configurations

The configuration of Authgear comes from three sources:

* [Environment Variable](env.md)
* [authgear.yaml](authgear.yaml.md)
* [authgear.secrets.yaml](authgear.secrets.yaml.md)

The three sources do not overlap with each other so all of them are required.

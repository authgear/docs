# Reference Architecture Diagrams

Authgear Enterprise Plan offers self-managed options for customers to run the whole application on their private cloud or public cloud instances using our docker images. This is generally useful for regulated industries such as Financial, Insurance or Public Sectors which must retain the processing and storage of user data on-premises or in specific geographical area.

### Deployment Options

* Depending on [backend-api](../../get-started/backend-api/ "mention") approach, Authgear Resolvers is not needed if your backend self-validate user cookies or JWT.
* It's recommended to use managed redis, postgresql and elasticsearch to reduce maintenance overhead.
* Persistent redis is optional â€” the advantage of persistent redis is users can keep their session in the event of redis restart or downtime.
* User profile image is disabled by default, if enabled an S3-Compatible Object Storage is required.
* Elasticsearch is optional and only needed to support user search in the Authgear admin portal.
* Please refer to [helm.md](../helm.md "mention") for deployment options and details.

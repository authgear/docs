# Single Sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) is defined as login once, logged in all apps. If you have multiple mobile apps or websites that wants to streamline the user experiences. You can configure your apps to turn on the SSO feature, so the end-users only have to enter their authentication credentials once.

There are multiple ways to achieve Single Sign-on, with various pros-and-cons:

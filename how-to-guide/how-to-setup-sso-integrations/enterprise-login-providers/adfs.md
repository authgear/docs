# Connect Apps to Microsoft AD FS

## Prerequisite

1. Setup your own AD FS server
2. Create an application in your AD FS Server, obtain "Client ID", "Client Secret" and "Discovery Document Endpoint". Discovery Document Endpoint typically ends with `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Configure your application with redirect uri `https://<YOUR_AUTHGEAR_ENDPOINT>/sso/oauth2/callback/adfs`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Redirect URI has the form of `/sso/oauth2/callback/:alias`. The `alias` is used as the identifier of OAuth provider. You can configure the `alias` in Authgear Portal.
{% endhint %}

## Configure Sign in with Microsoft AD FS through the portal

1. In the portal, go to **Authentication > Social / Enterprise Login**.
2. Enable **Sign in with Microsoft AD FS**.
3. Fill in **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Discovery Document Endpoint**.
4. **Save** the settings.

ðŸŽ‰ Done! You have just added Microsoft AD FS Login to your apps!

### Force Users to Re-authenticate

Microsoft AD FS supports the `prompt=login` parameter. You can include this parameter in your request when you want users to re-authenticate. See our [guide on using the prompt=login parameter](../force-social-enterprise-login-providers-to-show-login-screen.md) in Authgear SDKs to learn more.

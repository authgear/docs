# Configuration

The configuration of Authgear comes from:

* [Environment Variable](env.md)
* [authgear.yaml](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LuqTf44PgRaiOT3T9fc/s/-MAjXpMovvVxeIY33s_K/~/changes/430/deployment/configuration/authgear.yaml)
* [authgear.secrets.yaml](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LuqTf44PgRaiOT3T9fc/s/-MK30eFTJ0M1-TIrYtRR/)

The three sources do not overlap with each other, so all of them are required.

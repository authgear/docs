# Run with Docker

Authgear is available as a Docker image. It depends on PostgreSQL (with pg\_partman enabled) and Redis.

To simplify running Authgear locally with Docker, we provide an example repository that includes a complete setup and step-by-step instructions.

**Clone the example repo and follow the included** `README.md`: \
[https://github.com/authgear/authgear-example-docker-compose](https://github.com/authgear/authgear-example-docker-compose)

The repository contains:

* Preconfigured `docker-compose.yml`
* Example environment files
* Guidance for initializing the project and running the portal + backend
* Tips for troubleshooting local development setups

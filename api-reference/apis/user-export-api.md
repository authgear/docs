# User Export API

The User Export API allows developers to bulk export users into a [CSV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) or [ndjson](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) file.

The export process is asynchronous. That is, the process runs in the background. Hence, you will need to initiate an export task in one endpoint call and then, make an additional call to another endpoint to get the status of the export task.

### Authentication <a href="#authentication" id="authentication"></a>

To use the Export User API, your application must be authenticated using an [Admin API JWT token](https://docs.authgear.com/reference/apis/admin-api/authentication-and-security).

Once you obtain a valid Admin API JWT, you can set it as a Bearer Authorization header to access the Export User API Endpoints. The API will return a "403 Forbidden" error if an invalid JWT is used.

## Endpoints

The following are the two endpoints for the User Export API:

### Initiate Export Task <a href="#initiate-export-task" id="initiate-export-task"></a>

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `/_api/admin/users/export`

Use this endpoint to create a new user export task.

**Headers**

| Name          | Value                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Content-Type  | `application/json`               |
| Authorization | `Bearer <Admin API JWT Token>`   |
| Host          | `<Your Authgear Project domain>` |

**Body**

The Initiate Export endpoint accepts JSON input via an HTTP(S) request body. The following is an example of the input:

```json
{
  "format": "csv",
  "csv": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "pointer": "/sub",
        "field_name": "user_id"
      },
      {
        "pointer": "/email"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

* The `format` field is where you specify the format of the export file. The value can be `csv` or `ndjson`.
* `csv`: use this field when `format` is set to `csv`. The value is an object with a `fields` property.
* `csv.fields`: you can use this field to list all the user attributes you want to include as fields in the CSV file. The value should be an array and each item in the array is an object with a `pointer` and an optional `field_name` property that describe a user attribute.

#### **User Profile Attribute Pointers**

The following is a complete list of supported pointers:

| Pointer                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Value   |

If `csv.fields` is not specified, all the above pointers will be included as fields in the exported CSV file.

The value for `pointer` for a custom attribute will follow this format:

```json
{"pointer": "/custom_attributes/CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_NAME"}
```

For example, a custom attribute named `member_id` will be `{"pointer": "/custom_attributes/member_id"}`.

If `field_name` is not given, then it is derived from `pointer` using the following rules:

1. Let `parts` be the list of the reference tokens in `pointer`.
2. Join `parts` with the character `.`.

For example, following the above roles, the derived field\_name for `{"pointer": "/address/formatted"}` will be `address.formatted`.

* The `status` field reports progress on the current export task. If the value is `completed`, the export is complete, and you can now download the export file.
* `download_url`: This is a signed URL that you can use to download the export file.

**Note:** The result from a completed export task will expire after 24 hours. Hence, after 24 hours, you can no longer use the task ID associated with the task to generate a new download link.

| When user export is disabled                  | `InternalError` | `UserExportDisabled` | -    |

## Download Export File <a href="#download-export-file" id="download-export-file"></a>

The response of the check status endpoint will include a `download_url` field that contains a signed URL that you can open to download the [CSV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) or [ndjson](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) user export file.

The signed URL is only valid for 60 seconds, and afterwards, you'll have to make another request to the **check status** endpoint using the **task ID** to obtain a new URL.

## Usage Example

See the following guide for a detailed example of how to use the Export User API:

{% content-ref url="../../admin/user-management/export-users-using-the-user-export-api.md" %}
[export-users-using-the-user-export-api.md](../../admin/user-management/export-users-using-the-user-export-api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

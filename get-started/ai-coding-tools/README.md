# AI Coding tools

Generative AI powered by large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software development, giving rise to a new paradigm called “Vibe Coding.” This approach empowers individuals with ideas—regardless of their coding expertise—to create software quickly and intuitively. For developers, generative AI automates repetitive tasks, boosts productivity, and even enhances code quality in some cases.

While vibe coding is undeniably exciting, there’s one area where caution is essential: security. AI-generated code can sometimes be buggy or incomplete, and when deployed in real-world applications, critical aspects like user authentication and data protection cannot be left to chance.

### Plug-and-Play Security with Authgear

To bridge this gap, Authgear offers a plug-and-play authentication solution that ensures your AI-generated applications are enterprise-grade secure. With the right prompts, developers can integrate robust security features into their projects in seconds. These features include:

* [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](../../how-to-guide/authenticate/enable-two-factor-authentication-2fa.md): Add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
* Email/Phone Verification with OTP: Ensure user identities are verified during sign-up or login.
* [Brute Force Protection](../../security/brute-force-protection.md): Safeguard against unauthorized access attempts.
* [Bot Protection](../../security/bot-protection.md): Keep malicious bots at bay.

By incorporating Authgear into your vibe coding workflow, you can focus on building innovative applications while ensuring top-notch security for your users.
